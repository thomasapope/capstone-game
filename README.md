# capstone-game
A survival defense game.

## Setting / Story:

Humanity has fallen. The last survivors have built primitive communities among the ruins of our past. Nature is no longer mans best friend. At night hordes of mutant animals come to attack communities to kidnap and enslave their children.

You play as the protectors of a community under siege. You must fight off the mutant hordes, maintain and upgrade your buildings, and find a way to escape to somewhere safer.

## Maps:
- Elementary
  - Your community has settled down among the delapidated ruins of an old elementary school. Survive the hordes while finding a way to repair one of the vehicles in the parking lot.


## Tools:
- Unity
- C#
- Blender
- Discord
- GitHub


## Planned Features:
- Community defense
- Upgradeable buildings that give perks to players
- Upgradeable characters (mostly through upgrading the community
- Score tracking (Waves survived, enemies killed)
- Resource management (Points of some sort, Ammo)
- Story mode
- Endless horde mode


## Technical Notes:
- Players and enemies inherit from a base "Creature" class, which holds code for moving, health, and other shared behaviors.

## Notes:
- The focus should be on the players as the heros of the game.
- Should not feel like a tower defense game.
- Gameplay should be designed to induce a healthy bit of panic.
- Collaboration with teamates should be neccesary to succeed.
- Most weapons are fairly primitive, but occasionally a rare relic of fallen humanity can be found.
- Setting is dark night in the ruins of a city. Most lighting is from lamps, torches, and campfires.
