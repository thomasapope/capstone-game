# capstone-game
A survival defense game.

At night hordes of enemies come to attack your community and steal your children. You must stop them by any means neccesary. 

Maintain and upgrade buildings, manage your resources, and use whatever weapons are at your disposal to defend yourself and your community.

## Tools:
- Unity
- C#
- Blender
- Discord
- GitHub

Viewpoint: Birds eye or isometric view

## Planned Features:
- Base defense
- Upgradeable buildings
- Upgradeable characters
- Score tracking (Waves survived, enemies killed)
- Resource management (Points of some sort, Ammo)


## Notes:
- The focus should be on the players as the heros of the game.
- Should not feel like a tower defense game.
- Gameplay should be designed to induce a healthy bit of panic.
- Collaboration with teamates should be neccesary to succeed.
