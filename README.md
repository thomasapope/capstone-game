# Hide Yo Kids
### By Joshua McCabe, Wilbur McElroy, and Thomas Pope
3D hack and slash game about protecting kids and finding a way to escape.

## Setting / Story:

Hide Yo Kids is a 3D hack and slash game where players must protect their family from invading hordes of mutated moles while searching for the parts to repair an escape vehicle. Players can do this through a combination of hiding their kids around the map and fighting off the moles. Enemies attack in progressively larger and more dangerous waves, challenging players to escape sooner rather than later. Once players have gathered the parts necessary to repair the escape vehicle, they must bring the children to the vehicle safely before the hordes get to them. 

This project involves the character and camera controllers, user interfaces, fighting systems, and AI behaviors and pathfinding. The game is built using the Unity game engine and C#. Discord and GitHub are used to communicate and collaborate, allowing us to share progress and stay up to date. The assets for the game are either made using Blender and tools in Unity or acquired from online asset stores.
