# capstone-game
A survival defense game.

Humanity has fallen. The last survivors have built primitive communities among the ruins of our past. Nature is no longer mans best friend.

At night hordes of mutant animals come to attack your community and steal your children. You must stop them by any means neccesary. 

Maintain and upgrade buildings, manage your resources, and use whatever weapons are at your disposal to defend yourself and your community.

## Tools:
- Unity
- C#
- Blender
- Discord
- GitHub


## Planned Features:
- Base defense
- Upgradeable buildings
- Upgradeable characters
- Score tracking (Waves survived, enemies killed)
- Resource management (Points of some sort, Ammo)


## Technical Notes:
- Players and enemies inherit from a base "Creature" class, which holds code for moving, health, and other shared behaviors.

## Notes:
- The focus should be on the players as the heros of the game.
- Should not feel like a tower defense game.
- Gameplay should be designed to induce a healthy bit of panic.
- Collaboration with teamates should be neccesary to succeed.
- Most weapons are fairly primitive, but occasionally a rare relic of fallen humanity can be found.
- Setting is dark night in the ruins of a city. Most lighting is from lamps, torches, and campfires.
